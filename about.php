        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Hello.  I’m Ben, and this is my story.</h2>
      </hgroup>
      <p>I was born in Neeopoeteren, in the east part of Limburg, Belgium.</p>
      <p>I first started racing BMX when I was young and was instantly hooked.  After I got a bit older I started racing mountain bike, including the 1993 world championship in Metabief, France, as a junior.  But there was no junior mountain bike racing in Belgium at that time.  So, at 16 I started racing cyclocross, and I was from the very beginning I was winning races.   Finally in 1996, I won the Belgian U23 championships.</p>
      <p>I’ve now been racing professionally for 14 years.  A lot of ups and downs in that time, including some great wins.  For the 2011-2012 season I’m excited to spend the first half of the season racing in the US.  In the last part of my career, I’m looking forward to new challenges and meeting new people. </p>
